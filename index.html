                        I worked as a Software and Project Development Specialist at Süvari from 2018 to 2023. I’m currently working
                        as a Software and Project Development Manager at the same company. Here, we develop SaaS projects focused on
                        the retail sector and offer them under the Devoplus brand, which is affiliated with the same group.

                        I have expertise in Microsoft technologies such as .NET, Typescript, WPF, MAUI. I have had the opportunity
                        to use MongoDB in many of my projects since it was released. I’m at an expert level in performance, backup
                        and management issues.

                        I developed software in the field of Neuromarketing for more than 3 years. I use and try to transfer to my
                        team members the artificial intelligence, big data processing and user experience skills that I gained there
                        in the projects we develop within Devoplus. I’m especially interested in database technologies and big data.

                        I also have experience in many areas outside of software, such as Azure products, ERP infrastructures,
                        integrations, network and system infrastructures. I have been interested in hobby electronics for about 10
                        years. I combine my software and cloud technology skills with this field and use Arduino and Raspberry Pi to
                        create various hobby IoT projects to smarten my home and car.
